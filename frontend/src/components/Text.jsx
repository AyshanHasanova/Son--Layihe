        A lot of so-called stretch denim pants out there are just glorified sweatpants â€“ they get baggy and lose<br />
        their shape. Not cool. Our tightly knitted fabric holds its form after repeated wear. Plus, Aldays dress up<br />
        or down, no prob. So you can wear them all day. Get it?
